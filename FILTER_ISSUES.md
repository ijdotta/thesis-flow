# Project Filters - Issues Found & Fixed

## Understanding of Filter Parameters

### FE sends these filter keys for projects:
- `title` (text input)
- `type` (select: "THESIS" or "PROJECT")
- `career` (text input - searching by career name) - **DIFFERENT from domain!**
- `domain` (application domain/area) - **DIFFERENT from career!**
- `directors` (text input - professor name)
- `students` (text input)
- `completion` (select: "true" or "false" as STRING)

### BE Should Support:
- `title` ✅
- `type` ✅ (with special handling)
- `domain` ✅ (application domain - kept separate)
- `career` ✅ (career filter - kept separate)
- `directors` or `professor.name` ✅ (filter by professor name)
- `professor.id` ✅ (NEW: filter by professor public ID)
- `students` or `student.name` ✅
- `completion` ⚠️ (receives string "true"/"false" but expects Boolean)

## Issues Fixed:

1. **Career vs Domain**: These are SEPARATE filters, not aliases
   - `domain` = Application Domain/Area (e.g., "Web Development")
   - `career` = Academic Career (e.g., "Computer Science")
   - Both must be supported independently

2. **Professor ID filter**: Need to support filtering by professor public ID
   - Add `professor.id` parameter alongside `professor.name`
   - Use public ID for filtering (not internal database ID)

3. **Completion filter string conversion**: FE sends "true"/"false" as strings
   - Need to handle string-to-boolean conversion in BE

## Solution:
- Keep `career` and `domain` as separate filter parameters
- Add `professor.id` parameter for filtering by professor public ID
- Convert string completion values to boolean
